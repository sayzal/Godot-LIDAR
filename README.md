A working LIDAR for Godot 4.X

This code is based entirely on RythonDev code (https://github.com/Ryhon0/GodotLidar), huge thanks to his work. 
Difference between RythonDev's and this repository:
1. His work was written completely in C#, and this repository contains a code rewritten in GDScript
2. Updated the code to Godot 4.X
